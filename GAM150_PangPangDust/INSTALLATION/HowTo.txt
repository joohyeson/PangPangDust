Step 2. Change AppID
	Inside Inno Setup Compiler IDE, click Tools -> Generate GUID
	then paste the new id in [Setup]

Step 2a. (icon file)
	Put icon file in GAMEDIRECTORY/, then uncomment the following lines

	; #define MyIconName "GameTest.ico"
	; SetupIconFile={#MyDistributionFolder}/{#MyIconName}

	Change the icon name from "GameTest.ico" to the actual file name
	
Step 3. Modify other settings for additional redistributable packages
	If there're other redistributables needed to be installed
	Modify settings in [Tasks], [Files], [Run]

Step 3a. (icon file)
	The current version of InnoSetup does not support macros for IconFilename.
